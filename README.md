What about of our products?
# Hello, Friends!

I’m your new assistant — **Polar Bear‑Engineer** from **«RV Polar Bear»**! 🐻❄️

Today, I’ll tell you about our amazing development kits: **PBKit 101** and **PBKit 101‑A‑Base**. If you dream of launching a prototype or small‑scale product quickly and hassle‑free, these kits are perfect for you!

## What Are PBKit 101 and PBKit 101‑A‑Base?

These are ready‑to‑use platform solutions for developing electronic devices based on modern microcontrollers and FPGAs. We’ve packed everything you need into one kit:

- A development board with a processor/FPGA;
- Basic peripherals (USB, Ethernet, GPIO, ADC, DAC, etc.);
- Pre‑installed software and drivers;
- Documentation and code examples.

- **PBKit 101** is our «basic champion»: ideal for getting started, learning, and rapid prototyping.
- **PBKit 101‑A‑Base** is an extended version: more interfaces, memory, and capabilities for complex projects.

## Why Are These Kits Awesome? Let’s Break It Down!

1. **Everything in One Box**  
   No need to spend hours searching for components, checking compatibility, or soldering «on the go». We’ve already selected, tested, and packaged everything. Just unpack, connect, and start coding!

2. **Save Time and Money**  
   No extra purchases. You get a complete kit at a fixed price that covers 80 % of typical development tasks.

3. **Flexibility and Scalability**  
   Both kits support:
   - Connecting additional modules (sensors, displays, radio modules);
   - Over‑the‑air (OTA) software updates;
   - Working with popular OSes (Linux, RTOS).

4. **Documentation — Our Pride!**  
   We’ve written detailed guides in Russian:
   - How to connect the board;
   - How to set up the development environment;
   - Code examples for all interfaces;
   - FAQ on common errors.

5. **Support from Polar Bear**  
   If anything is unclear — just contact us! We’ll respond quickly, clearly, and without bureaucracy. Our tech support is like a warm cup of tea in an Arctic storm. 🫖

## What Else Can We Do?

We don’t just sell great kits — we also:
- Deliver electronic components (from resistors to processors). Everything is certified and comes with a warranty.
- Manufacture custom PCBs — any complexity, from prototypes to series. Lead time: from 5 days.
- Develop custom solutions — if you need a unique product, we’ll help with design and implementation.

## Why Choose Us?

- **Experience.** We’ve been in the market for 10 years and know all the pitfalls of development.
- **Quality.** Our boards go through 3 stages of control: production, assembly, and final testing.
- **Speed.** From request to shipment — minimal bureaucracy, maximum action.
- **Support.** We’re always available: email, phone, Telegram — choose your preferred channel.

## Where to Buy?

Visit our website **RV Polar Bear** or email us at **polarbear.embedded@yandex.ru**. We’ll respond within 2–3 hours and help you choose the best option.

**PBKit 101** and **PBKit 101‑A‑Base** aren’t just boards — they’re your fast start in the world of electronics. With them, you’ll:
- Save time on component sourcing;
- Avoid compatibility issues;
- Get a ready‑made base for scaling.

And if you need something special — remember: we deliver electronic components and manufacture custom PCBs. Everything is «turnkey», with a warranty and on time.

Thank you for reading to the end! 🐻
